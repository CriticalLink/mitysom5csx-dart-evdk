This is based off the original BCON demo_app (from 
 git://support.criticallink.com/home/git/mitysom-5cs/mitysom_5csx_dev_board.git
 branch bcon_adaptor). The application has been converted to boot with autotools
 and is being modified to fit the structure we desire for the VDK

The following steps will allow you to cross-compile for the 5csx

autoreconf --install
./configure --host arm-poky-linux-gnueabi
make
